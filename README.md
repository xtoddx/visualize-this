Notes and experiments related to Nathan Yau's _Visualize This_.

I intend to collect data presented in the book, such as links and references,
and use that data as a source for visualizations.  Building a compiler in your
own programming language is the fist step to maturity, so I figure I should
try and extract the same self-referential data from visualizations.
